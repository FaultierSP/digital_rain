# Digital rain
The only purpose of this program is to display the "digital rain" effect used in the "Matrix" universe. The program uses the Bevy engine, which is probably an overkill for this purpose, but it was the only engine that came with all neat effects I needed right out of the box.

You can change the window and the size of the characters will adapt, or press F11 to toggle the full-screen mode.

## Nice to have / contribution
In the future it would be nice to add some features like a blur or CRT effect. Feel free to contribute.
